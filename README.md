Hi, I'm @luiz5navarro1.
I'm interested in programming languages such as C, C++ (my original background), SQL and Python.
I'm also interested in Salesforce CRM, and because of that I'm writing code in Apex (similar to Java), SOQL and SOSL (similar
to SQL), Javascript, HTML and CSS.
I'm currently improving my Salesforce capabilities, willing to take my Salesforce Developer 1 certification, and doing as much
work as I can in my original background languages.
I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving logics, no matter the programming language used, so I can keep growing on my
knowledge.
I can be reached at luiz5navarro1@gmail.com
